Since i was amazed by fractals , i wanted to write a code that would eventually render something that looks like a fractal so i checked wikipedia(yes it is my source)
and found the chaos theory which is :<br>
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vn+1 = 1/2(Vn + Prn)<br>
<br>using SFML i rendered a screen and then made points that eventually followed this rule .
hope u find it interesting !
